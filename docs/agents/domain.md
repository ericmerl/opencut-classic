# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Current layout

This repository uses the single-context layout: `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repository root.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If either location doesn't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag its absence or suggest creating it upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill—reached through `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`—creates these files lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-example-decision.md
│   └── 0002-another-decision.md
├── apps/
├── packages/
└── rust/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept—in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name—use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use, or there's a real gap to note for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (example decision)—but worth reopening because…_
